# ASIC-Monitor

The purpose of this repository is to monitor the f2pool mining API which will contain the information of the Bitcoin ASIC miners. The hashrate of the miners will be monitored and if the monitor detects that the miner is offline it will activate the script to use the linear actuators to perform a power cycle to get the miner back online. The repository also contains a discord bot that can be added to a server to receive updates on the actions that the monitoring script is performing.
